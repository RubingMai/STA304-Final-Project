# STA304-Final-Project

Two data sets are used in this project.
 
Raw survey data("2019 Canadian Election Study - Online Survey v1.0.dta.zip") is too large and so has trouble to upload. So I zip the file. Please download it and unzip the file if needed.

Raw census data("AAu01LGi.csv.zip") is also large, and so I zip the file. Please download it and unzip the file if needed.

Cleaned survey data("survey_data.csv.zip") and cleaned census data("census_data.csv.zip") are uploaded to my respository. Please download it and unzip the file if needed.


The followings are some explanations about files:

1. "Change in the 2019 Canadian Federal Election Result if Everyone had Voted.Rmd" is the rmd file about final project.

2. "STA304 FINAL PROJECT.pdf" is the pdf file about final project.

3. "Prepare and clean the survey data.R" is the file used to clean raw survey data and prepare for later post stratification.

4. "Prepare and clean the census data.R" is the file used to clean raw census data and prepare for later post stratification.

5. "gss_labels.txt" and "gss_dict.txt" are used in "Prepare and clean the census data.R" to clean raw census data.
