# STA304-Final-Project

Two data sets are used in this project.

Raw survey data, 2019 Canadian Election Study - Online Survey is downloaded from https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DUS88V
 
Raw survey data(2019 Canadian Election Study - Online Survey v1.0.dta) is too large and so has trouble to upload. Please download it from previous links if needed.

Raw census data, General social survey on Family (cycle 31), 2017 is downloaded from https://sda-artsci-utoronto-ca.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/cgi-bin/sda/hsda?harcsda4+gss31

Raw census data(AAu01LGi.csv) is also large, but I upload it to my respository. If it has trouble to open, please download it from previous links if needed.

Cleaned survey data(survey_data.csv) and cleaned census data(census_data.csv) are uploaded to my respository. Used them if needed.


The followings are some explanations about files:

1. "Change in the 2019 Canadian Federal Election Result if Everyone had Voted.Rmd" is the rmd file about final project.

2. "Prepare and clean the survey data.R" is the file used to clean raw survey data and prepare for later post stratification.

3. "Prepare and clean the census data.R" is the file used to clean raw census data and prepare for later post stratification.

4. "gss_labels.txt" and "gss_dict.txt" are used in "Prepare and clean the census data.R" to clean raw census data.
