# STA304-Final-Project

 Two data are used in this project.

 Raw survey data, 2019 Canadian Election Study - Online Survey is downloaded from https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DUS88V
 
 Raw survey data is too large and so has trouble to upload. Please download it from previous links if needed.

 Raw census data, General social survey on Family (cycle 31), 2017 is downloaded from https://sda-artsci-utoronto-ca.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/cgi-bin/sda/hsda?harcsda4+gss31

 Raw census data is also large, but I upload it to my respository. If it has trouble to open, please download it from previous links if needed.

Cleaned survey data and cleaned census data are uploaded to my respository. Used them if needed.
